## Assignment

## 1. Design and implement a data type WeightedGraph that uses either an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. How are you going to store the weights?

## 2. While one partner is doing this, the other one should write a class that reads a graph from a file. See notes on the file format and the example file below!

## 3. Now write a method that will take a graph and two vertices and find the shortest path between the vertices. Make a method to print out the path in a readable format. What class will these methods belong to?

## 4. Meanwhile, your partner writes a method that takes a graph, picks two vertices at random, and finds the cheapest path between the two.

## 5. Starting from S Sch√∂neweide Bhf (Berlin) compute the shortest travel times to the 4 Stations below.
